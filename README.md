# excel-powerbi-sales-analysis-mini-project
End-to-end sales and revenue  and Power BI, including data cleaninganalysis using Excel, group-by modelling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards.
## Project Overview

This repository showcases a production-style data analytics project built using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. The project follows industry best practices for data analysis, including structured data exploration, preprocessing, modelling with group-by aggregations, DAX-based calculations, and insight-driven visual reporting.

The objective is to convert raw sales data into actionable business insights while demonstrating practical skills expected from a data analyst.

## Dataset Information

Source: Kaggle

Date Collected: January 18, 2025

Format: Excel (.xlsx)

Type: Sales transactional data

Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Excel

Microsoft Power BI

Power Query

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

## Project Workflow Summary
1. Data Exploration

Reviewed dataset structure and features

Identified key variables such as date, product, quantity, price, discount flag, and revenue

Performed initial validation using Excel and Power BI table visuals

2. Data Preprocessing

Loaded Kaggle dataset into Excel

Cleaned data by handling blanks, correcting data types, and standardizing values

Created calculated columns such as price per unit and total revenue

Imported cleaned data into Power BI

3. Data Modelling

Built Power BI data model using base transactional table

Created Group By tables in Power Query for:

Product / Category-level analysis

Date-based trend analysis

Discount vs non-discount comparison

Developed DAX measures:

Total Revenue

Discounted Revenue

Total Quantity Sold

4. Visualization & Analysis

Designed interactive Power BI reports and dashboard

Used KPI cards, bar charts, column charts, and line charts

Implemented slicers for date, category, and discount status

Key Findings & Business Insights

Discounted products sell higher quantities but reduce per-unit revenue

Non-discounted sales contribute more to overall profitability

Certain products and categories consistently outperform others

Sales and revenue vary across different time periods
